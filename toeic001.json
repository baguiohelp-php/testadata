The Pro Phone 4, which includes 512 GB of storage, a 7-inch screen display, and an optional stylus pen, will hit the shelves on 11 June. Unlike its predecessor—the Pro Phone 3—it features a larger screen, an ultrawide camera lens, and 8K-resolution filming capability.</p><p>—<b>[1]</b>—. The £999 starting price is £100 more than that of the previous model. Add-ons, such as the stylus, protective case, and wireless headphones, cost an additional £39, £59, and £79, respectively. Gorman Product Manager Ian Hill doesn't believe the price increase will dissuade customers. —<b>[2]</b>—.</p><p>'The Pro Phone 4 is a game changer in terms of its picture quality and sleek design,' said Hill. 'Improvements were based on direct customer feedback, which cited poor camera functionality as the biggest drawback of prior models. Our clients spoke, and we listened and adapted accordingly.' —<b>[3]</b>—.</p><p>One similarity that the Pro Phone 4 has with previous models is the charger. Going against the trend of competing wireless companies, Gorman is instead focusing on convenience.</p><p>'We want to afford our customers the ability to reuse elements of the other Gorman devices they've already purchased,' said Hill.

I am happy to help you with that. I understand that you do not feel that a high degree of security is needed for your voice-mail settings, but the new system does require you to have a password to retrieve your voice mail. However, company policy allows me to change the settings for employees who do not work with confidential material. I can update the security settings so that you do not have to reset the password on a regular basis.</p><p>I want to make sure that you understand the risk involved with a lower level of security. Anyone who gains access to your voice-mail account can do more than simply listen to your messages. They would be able to delete messages, change your greeting, or change your password so that you would lose access to your voice mail (at least until someone here at IT could override the password change). If you still feel comfortable with that level of risk, let me know, and I will change the settings so that your password never expires.</p><p>Sam Arnold<br>Tech Support Associate</p><p><b>176.</b><br><b>(A)</b> It provides mobile phones to some employees.<br><b>(B)</b> Its employees value confidentiality.<br><b>(C)</b> It has recently changed its phone system.<br><b>(D)</b> It offers technology training to employees.</p><p><b>177.</b><br><b>(A)</b> periodic<br><b>(B)</b> orderly<br><b>(C)</b> customary<br><b>(D)</b> legitimate</p><p><b>178.</b><br><b>(A)</b> In a weekly managers' meeting<br><b>(B)</b> In a work order<br><b>(C)</b> In a phone call<br><b>(D)</b> In a personal voice mail</p><p><b>179.</b><br><b>(A)</b> By agreeing to everything Ms. Xi asked for<br><b>(B)</b> By resetting the password on Ms. Xi's phone<br><b>(C)</b> By referring the matter to another technician<br><b>(D)</b> By proposing to fulfill only part of Ms. Xi's request</p><p><b>180.</b><br><b>(A)</b> Make the needed changes to her voice-mail system<br><b>(B)</b> Attend training about the new voice-mail system<br><b>(C)</b> Confirm that she wants him to change her voice-mail system<br><b>(D)</b> Provide a clear description of the problem with her voice-mail system</p><h3>Questions 181–185</h3><p><b>E-mail and Review</b></p><p><b>E-mail:</b></p><p>To: Linda Hanshu<br>From: Cliff Merson<br>Subject: Lighting Issue<br>Date: September 4, 10:12 A.M.</p><p>Hi, Ms. Hanshu:</p><p>I want to check on the issue we discussed about lighting in the latest chapter of <i>Titan Adventure</i>. In past versions of the game, getting the reflections and lighting in green and blue areas correct has been a particular challenge, and it was a problem that kept arising. As the new release, <i>Neptune's Voyage</i>, is primarily an underwater adventure, addressing this problem is crucial. You said you would take charge of this, and I hope to hear that you have found a solution to the problem. The team was hoping to have one last rendering of the lighting for the game by October 10 for a preliminary run-through. Will the final version of the lighting be ready by then?</p><p>All other aspects of the game are on schedule. Please send me an update about the lighting at your earliest convenience.</p><p>Regards,<br>Cliff Merson<br>Project Manager, Rimerko Games</p><p><b>Review of Titan Adventure: Neptune's Voyage</b></p><p>By Leo Weber, April 1</p><p>This new installment of <i>Titan Adventure</i> will surprise and delight both new players and old aficionados long familiar with the series. Though open-world formats have been widespread in recent years, <i>Neptune's Voyage</i> brings something new to the format. By stripping down instructional guides, the game gives users the opportunity to discover new areas and devices. In <i>Neptune's Voyage</i>, you wake up as Thena, a dolphin that is tasked with rescuing Neptune from an underwater cave. Users then climb, ride, sail, and fly through the world of the game, encountering new towns, ruins, and other creatures along the way. Some of these creatures will be familiar to longtime fans, but there is plenty of novelty as well. This newest version also corrects the green and blue image rendering that was sometimes a problem in earlier installments of <i>Titan Adventure</i>.</p><p><i>Neptune's Voyage</i> launches May 5 on Rimerko Clutch and FS5.

It provides wonderful insight into his career, starting with his first roles in cinema in his native Sweden, moving into his work in France and Italy, and finishing with his recent theatre work in the U.K.</p><p>In his book, Mr. Eklund dedicates a fair amount of text to discussing his mentor, Charles Gunnarsson, who helped him develop his skills early on in Stockholm. He also describes the difficulty of transitioning into different types of roles, especially from comedic to dramatic acting. He includes several funny anecdotes about his first attempts at acting onstage here in London. He describes them as disastrous, but anyone who saw his recent performance in <i>Life and Games</i> would say just the opposite.</p><p>Mr. Eklund has long been a captivating actor on stage and screen, and now he is a thoroughly engaging author.</p><p>—Uma Joshi</p><p><b>E-mail 1:</b></p><p>To: Edith Hocking<br>From: Uma Joshi<br>Date: 2 March<br>Subject: RE: Opportunity</p><p>Dear Edith,</p><p>Thank you for agreeing to arrange an interview with Mr. Eklund for me.
